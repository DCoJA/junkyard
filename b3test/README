An example of hachidori server using UDP protocol.   The primary
purpose of this software is to be a test program for hachidori
remote sensor/actuator.  It shows hachidori sensor packets with
human readable forms.  Also it can send packets for the atitude
control. The atitude computation uses Madgwick AHRS algorithms
and his implementation in C:

The licence of the files other than Madgwick AHRS files is
3-term BSD which can be seen at the top of each files.
The program requires /dev/input/js0 of which default sticks
are allocated as below:

axis 0 - roll axis
axis 1 - pitch axis
axis 2 - theottle axis
axis 3 - yaw axis

The hachidori UDP port is 5790.
